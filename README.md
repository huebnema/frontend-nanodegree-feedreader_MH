This is my version of the Udacity frontend-nanodegree-feedreader project.

How to open this project:
1.  Download the project
2.  Launch the index.html file - this will display the page as well as the Jasmine test suite at the bottom of the page.

To remove the Jasmine test suite from the page, simply remove or comment out the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js link from the bottom of the index.html file.
